# Galactic Core

**The Programmable Commerce Platform by Tybrite Labs**

Galactic Core is the programmable interface layer that transforms GalacticOS into a globally accessible **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)** for commerce. Rather than rebuilding commerce logic from scratch, Galactic Core re-exposes the operational depth of a production-grade retail system through clean, versioned REST APIs.

## Why Galactic Core?

Instead of building commerce software, you are building on **commerce infrastructure**. This programmable foundation allows developers to leverage years of operational hardening through simple API calls:

  <Card title="Operational Depth" icon="layer-group">
    Inventory with reorder logic, automatic double-entry accounting, and order reconciliation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Global Velocity" icon="bolt">
    Edge-optimized delivery with 10-50ms response times and three-tier caching (Edge → Redis → DB).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unified Logic" icon="puzzles-piece">
    Centralized business rules—no data silos or duplicated logic across different sales channels.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Auditability" icon="shield-check">
    Every state change is tracked and traceable, providing a complete audit trail of commerce operations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Platform Pillars

Our architecture is divided into five main functional pillars, accessible via our REST endpoints:

  <Card title="Core Commerce" icon="shopping-bag">
    High-performance products, collections, orders, and customer management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Discovery" icon="magnifying-glass">
    AI-powered semantic search and product recommendations using embeddings.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Checkout & Logistics" icon="truck">
    Multi-provider payments (Stripe, M-Pesa, etc.), shipping, and dynamic pricing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Experience & Support" icon="user">
    Customer authentication, gift cards, promotions, and headless messaging.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Performance & Reliability

Galactic Core is designed for high-scale, production-grade applications:

- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Responses are served from the edge to ensure maximum performance globally.
- **Idempotency**: All write operations (like order creation) support idempotency keys to prevent duplicates on retry.
- **Field Filtering**: Most list endpoints support the `fields` parameter, allowing you to reduce payload size by up to 90%.

## Authentication

All API requests require an API key in the `Authorization` header. We support two distinct key types for security:

- **Publishable Keys (`pk_...`)**: Safe for client-side use in websites and mobile apps. Limited to read-only operations.
- **Secret Keys (`sk_...`)**: For secure, backend-only environments. grants full read/write access.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer tybrite_sk_live_YOUR_KEY
```
