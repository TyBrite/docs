The `GiftCardsService` class (accessed via `client.giftCards`) manages the checking and redemption of store-issued gift cards.

## Methods

### `checkGiftCard`

Retrieve the current balance and status of a gift card code. This endpoint is public-safe and can be used in your "Check Balance" UI.

```typescript
const details = await client.giftCards.checkGiftCard({
  code: 'TYB-GIFT-123-456'
});

console.log(`Remaining Balance: ${details.balance}`);
console.log(`Status: ${details.status}`); // 'active', 'redeemed', or 'expired'
```

---

### `redeemGiftCard`

Apply a gift card amount to an order. 

<Note>
  This is a sensitive operation that requires a **Secret Key**. It should be called from your backend during the checkout finalization process.
</Note>

```typescript
const result = await client.giftCards.redeemGiftCard({
  requestBody: {
    code: 'TYB-GIFT-123-456',
    amount: 5000, // Amount to deduct from the card
    order_id: 'ord_789' // Optional: Link the redemption to an order
  }
});

if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Redeemed! Remaining on card: ${result.remaining_balance}`);
}
```

## Card Lifecycle

Gift cards in Tybrite move through three states:

*   **Active**: Valid for use and has a non-zero balance.
*   **Redeemed**: The balance has been fully utilized.
*   **Expired**: The card has passed its `expires_at` date and can no longer be used, regardless of balance.

<Tip>
  To let customers pay for partial orders with gift cards, use `checkGiftCard` to see the available balance first, then call `redeemGiftCard` for either the full order amount or the maximum available card balance.
