The `SystemService` class provides health checks and basic metadata about the Tybrite API. These methods are public and do not require authentication.

Access this service via `client.system`.

## Methods

### `getApiInfo`

Retrieve basic information about the API, including the current version and list of available endpoint prefixes.

```typescript
const info = await client.system.getApiInfo();

console.log(`Connected to: ${info.name} v${info.version}`);
```

---

### `healthCheck`

Verify the operational status of the Tybrite API gateway. This is useful for monitoring or connectivity troubleshooting.

```typescript
const health = await client.system.healthCheck();

if (health.status === 'healthy') {
  console.log('API is online and operational.');
}
```
