The `CmsService` class (accessed via `client.cms`) provides access to content-driven features like blog posts and lookbooks, allowing you to build rich discovery experiences and content-led commerce.

## Blog Posts

### `listPosts`

Retrieve a paginated list of blog posts. This is ideal for building a "News" or "Magazine" section on your storefront.

```typescript
const { posts, total } = await client.cms.listPosts({
  status: 'published',
  category: 'summer-trends',
  limit: 10,
  offset: 0
});

posts.forEach(post => {
  console.log(`${post.title} - Published on ${post.published_at}`);
});
```

**Post Metadata:**
The listing response includes light metadata like `excerpt`, `featured_image`, and `slug`. For the full content, use `getPost`.

---

### `getPost`

Retrieve the full content and tags for a specific blog post.

```typescript
const post = await client.cms.getPost({
  id: 'post-uuid-or-slug'
});

// Accessing localized HTML content
console.log(post.content); 
```

## Lookbooks

Lookbooks are curated collections of lifestyle images linked to specific products, perfect for "Shop the Look" features.

### `listLookbooks`

Retrieve a list of available lookbooks.

```typescript
const { lookbooks } = await client.cms.listLookbooks({
  status: 'published',
  limit: 12
});
```

---

### `getLookbook`

Retrieve the full details of a lookbook, including its image gallery and **linked products**.

```typescript
const lookbook = await client.cms.getLookbook({
  id: 'autumn-collection-uuid'
});

// The 'products' array contains full Product models,
// making it easy to render "Shop the Look" cards immediately.
lookbook.products.forEach(product => {
  console.log(`Includes: ${product.name}`);
});
```

<Tip>
  **Pro Discovery Tip:** Use Lookbooks to increase Average Order Value (AOV) by encouraging customers to buy entire outfits or coordinated room sets featured in lifestyle photography.
