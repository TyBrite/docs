The `CustomersService` class (accessed via `client.customers`) provides administrative and logistical control over customer profiles.

## Profile Management

### `createCustomer`

Create a new customer profile. This is ideal for bulk imports or custom CRM integrations. 

<Note>
  This method requires a **Secret Key** and should only be called from secure server-side environments.
</Note>

```typescript
const customer = await client.customers.createCustomer({
  requestBody: {
    email: 'client@example.com',
    full_name: 'John Doe',
    phone: '254711222333',
    customer_type: 'individual' // 'individual' or 'business'
  }
});
```

---

### `updateCustomer`

Perform partial updates on a customer record. Only the fields you provide will be modified.

<Note>
  This method requires a **Secret Key**.
</Note>

```typescript
const updated = await client.customers.updateCustomer({
  id: 'customer-uuid-here',
  requestBody: {
    status: 'active',
    address: '123 Business Way, Nairobi',
    full_name: 'John Updated'
  }
});
```

## Customer Utilities

### `getCustomerGiftCards`

Issue or purchase a new gift card linked to a specific customer's account.

```typescript
const giftCard = await client.customers.getCustomerGiftCards({
  id: 'customer-uuid-here',
  requestBody: {
    amount: 100000, // 1000.00 in smallest unit
    recipient_email: 'friend@example.com',
    message: 'Enjoy your shopping!'
  }
});

console.log(`Generated code: ${giftCard.code}`);
```

<Tip>
  **Segmentation Tip:** Use the `customer_type` field to distinguish between retail and wholesale (business) customers, which can then be used in the **Pricing Service** to apply different discount rules.
