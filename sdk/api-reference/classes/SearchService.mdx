The `SearchService` class (accessed via `client.search`) provides both traditional keyword-based search and advanced AI-powered semantic search capabilities.

## Methods

### `searchProducts`

Fast, keyword-based search optimized for exact matches, SKUs, and product names. It uses case-insensitive partial matching to find relevant results quickly.

```typescript
const result = await client.search.searchProducts({
  q: 'iPhone 15', // You can use 'q' or 'query'
  limit: 10
});

console.log(`Found ${result.totalResults} results in ${result.searchTimeMs}ms`);
```

### `semanticSearch`

Leverage LLM-powered semantic search that understands intent and context. This allows customers to find products using natural language descriptions even if they don't know the exact product name.

<Note>
  This method requires a **Secret Key** as it utilizes vector embedding computation.
</Note>

```typescript
const result = await client.search.semanticSearch({
  requestBody: {
    query: 'something waterproof for hiking in cold weather',
    categoryId: 'outdoor-gear-uuid', // Optional: scoped search
    limit: 5
  }
});
```

## Comparison: Text vs. Semantic

| Feature | `searchProducts` (Text) | `semanticSearch` (AI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | ILIKE Pattern matching | Vector Cosine Similarity |
| **Best For** | SKUs, Model numbers, Exact names | Natural language, Intent, "Vibes" |
| **Example** | "MacBook Pro", "SKU-990" | "a laptop for professional video editing" |
| **Speed** | Ultra-fast (< 50ms) | Fast (< 250ms) |

<Tip>
  **Zero-Result Fallback:** A powerful UX pattern is to first call `searchProducts`. If `totalResults` is 0, gracefully fallback to `semanticSearch` to suggest products that might still interest the user.
