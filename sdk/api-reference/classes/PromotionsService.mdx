The `PromotionsService` class (accessed via `client.promotions`) handles active store discounts, marketing campaigns, and coupon validation logic.

## Methods

### `listPromotions`

Retrieve a list of promotions based on their lifecycle status. This is useful for building a "Deals" or "Coupons" page on your storefront.

```typescript
const { promotions } = await client.promotions.listPromotions({
  status: 'active',
  cartTotal: '10000', // Filter for promos valid for a 100.00 cart
  limit: 20
});
```

**Filter: `cartTotal`**
Providing a `cartTotal` allows the engine to pre-filter promotions that the customer is actually eligible for based on their current shopping bag value.

---

### `getPromotion`

Fetch full configuration data for a promotion, including its exact discount logic and validity dates.

```typescript
const promo = await client.promotions.getPromotion({
  id: 'promo-uuid-or-code'
});

if (promo.discount_type === 'percentage') {
  console.log(`Discount: ${promo.discount_value}% OFF`);
} else {
  console.log(`Discount: SAVE ${promo.discount_value}`);
}
```

## Discount Types

Tybrite supports two primary promotion types out of the box:

*   **Percentage**: Deducts a relative percentage (e.g., 15%) from the order subtotal.
*   **Fixed**: Deducts a specific amount (e.g., $10) from the order subtotal.

<Tip>
  **Pro Marketing Tip:** Use the `scheduled` status filter to build a "Coming Soon" deals section to build anticipation for Black Friday or seasonal sales.
