The `RecommendationsService` class (accessed via `client.recommendations`) allows you to integrate AI-driven product suggestions into your storefront to increase discovery and conversion.

<Note>
  **Security Note:** All recommendation requests require a **Secret Key** because they leverage computationally intensive AI models and vector embeddings.

## Methods

### `getRecommendations`

Retrieve curated product suggestions based on various AI models. Use the examples below to see how to implement different recommendation strategies.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript Similar Products
// Get products similar in meaning or features to a specific item
const { recommendations } = await client.recommendations.getRecommendations({
  requestBody: {
    type: 'similar',
    productId: 'current-product-uuid',
    limit: 4
  }
});
```

```typescript Also Bought
// Frequently purchased together (co-purchase matrix)
const { recommendations } = await client.recommendations.getRecommendations({
  requestBody: {
    type: 'also-bought',
    productId: 'current-product-uuid',
    limit: 4
  }
});
```

```typescript Trending
// Currently popular products based on sales velocity
const { recommendations } = await client.recommendations.getRecommendations({
  requestBody: {
    type: 'trending',
    limit: 10
  }
});
```

```typescript Personalized
// Suggestions tailored to a specific customer's preferences and history
const { recommendations } = await client.recommendations.getRecommendations({
  requestBody: {
    type: 'personalized',
    customerId: 'customer-uuid-here',
    limit: 6
  }
});
```

```typescript Smart Bundles
// Semantic + Co-purchase analysis for bundle suggestions
const { recommendations } = await client.recommendations.getRecommendations({
  requestBody: {
    type: 'bundle',
    productId: 'current-product-uuid',
    limit: 3
  }
});
```
